<h1>Documentchain (DMS)</h1>
<h2>The Decentralized Document Blockchain</h2>
<p>Documentchain is a real-world blockchain project, the system is actively used for document revisions since 2018.</p>
<p>The hash value of any file is stored tamper-proof in a transaction with a time stamp. Later, the blockchain can confirm that the 
file has existed in this exact version since the time of the transaction.</p>
<p>So the decentralized blockchain solution brings the proof of existence - no more and no less. 
But this opens up a wide range of possibilities, for example in protecting your copyright.</p>
<p>For example, let's look at a engineer who has an idea for a new revolutionary device. He describes this and deposits it on the blockchain. 
Not the document, that is private and remains with him. Only the unique hash 
value is published and receives the time stamp. Months later, he picks up the idea again and creates initial calculations 
and CAD drawings. These are also published. He discusses details with others and moves step by step to the finished design. 
However, unexpected problems arise when the patent is filed: It is claimed that he has only recently taken over the idea from someone else. 
At this point, he can prove how long he has been working on the project. The timing of his idea and every step in his invention is documented beyond doubt.</p>
